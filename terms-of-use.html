Users must purchase in-app items to use the symbols (and associated materials) in our Service to create the logo. Logo Maker Shop retains the copyrights and all associated rights to the original symbols, but the non-exclusive license allows Users to use and display that symbol in the customized logo. The symbols (and other materials) used in any preliminary design that are not contained in the final version of the logo remain the property of Logo Maker Shop. Under this license, Users cannot sell, assign, or transfer rights to the symbol, but any trademark rights developed in the customized logo will be owned by the User.<br><br><br><br>2.

Each User agrees and acknowledges that he creates a logo at his own risk and that he is responsible for taking any actions necessary to determine whether its use will infringe any third party intellectual property, privacy, or publicity right.
