Users should visit this page periodically to review the Terms and Conditions because they legally determine the conditions under which they are allowed to use the Service. A User's continued access of this App shall be deemed acceptance of the modified agreement.<br><br>1. Services Generally.<br><br>(a) Description. The Service is an online offering where individuals or entities (“User" or collectively, "Users") can design and/or create a customized logo and/or business cards using materials and tools provided by Logo Maker Shop. Users agree that Logo Maker Shop is responsible for providing this service, and that Logo Maker Shop is not responsible for providing any other services or tasks not specifically outlined in these Terms.<br><br>(b) License. Users must purchase in-app items to use the symbols (and associated materials) in our Service to create the logo. Logo Maker Shop retains the copyrights and all associated rights to the original symbols, but the non-exclusive license allows Users to use and display that symbol in the customized logo. The symbols (and other materials) used in any preliminary design that are not contained in the final version of the logo remain the property of Logo Maker Shop. Under this license, Users cannot sell, assign, or transfer rights to the symbol, but any trademark rights developed in the customized logo will be owned by the User.<br><br><br><br>2.

Each User agrees and acknowledges that he creates a logo at his own risk and that he is responsible for taking any actions necessary to determine whether its use will infringe any third party intellectual property, privacy, or publicity right. User agrees to be solely responsible for the accuracy of the content of any logo created for User by Logo Maker Shop.<br><br><br>3. Rights to Use.<br><br>(a) User Information.
